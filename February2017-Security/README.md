# BPSUG February 2017 Meetup

* **Topic**: AD Security Discussion
* **Presenter**: [Sean Metcalf](https://twitter.com/PyroTek3)

## Materials

This was more of a discussion, with a kerberoasting bit in the middle.  It's been a while, but I vaguely recall the following coming up:

* [Detecting Kerberoasting](https://adsecurity.org/?p=3458) (See closing for list of kerberoasting references)
* [Detecting Kerberoasting with honeypot accounts](https://adsecurity.org/?p=3513)
* [Quintessential AD Security bit](https://adsecurity.org/?p=1684)
* [Australian Department of Defense on securing PowerShell](https://www.asd.gov.au/publications/protect/securing-powershell.htm) - great ammo for justifying updating PowerShell
